This is a Silicon IDE project, Silicon Labs or Keil uVision is recommended to develop and debug the code. 
  * Silicon Labs Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or Keil uVision
  * And a USB Debug Adaptor ![](https://www.silabs.com/content/usergenerated/asi/cloud/attachments/siliconlabs/en/community/mcu/8-bit/knowledge-base/jcr%3acontent/content/primary/blog/using_the_usb_debug-XeTq/images/8832b5dc-56ac-4f0e-a1d6-d2facba7f010.png)

### Installing

step 1. Donwload the code
step 2. Compile the project with Silicon Labs/uVision
step 3. Donwload it to the board and run it.

\* As it is hardware-specified, so it would not work on any board, so the installing is just a reference.

## Built With

* Silocon Labs or Keil uVision

## System architecture
The general architecture is,
